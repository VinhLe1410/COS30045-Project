        <h1>A Closer Look at Physicians Workforce of Australia and Other Countries</h1>
        <h2>Context</h2>
        <p>
            Physicians are crucial in healthcare systems as they are the primary point of contact for diagnosis, treatment, and care. 
            To ensure Australians (and individuals in other countries) receive high-quality healthcare, it is essential for Australia (and other nations) to have a well-staffed medical workforce.
            <br>
            <br>
            Distribution of Physicians' Age and Gender is needed to be discussed as they affected directly on the healthcare system. 
            Overall, an equally distributed age and gender demographic of physicians helps enhancing collaboration and patient care by providing diverse perspective and increase average empathy among physicians. 
            Additionally, workforce sustainability would be maintained as risk of sudden shortages of experienced physicians would less likely to happen, as well as knowledge transfering from experienced to new physicians would be stable.

        <h2>Purpose</h2>
        <p>
            This project aims to provide insights of demographic of physicians in Australia and other countries. Specifically, the visualisations answered these questions:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>How many physicians are in the workforce within a country in the most recent year? How are they distributed?</li>
            <li>How physicians in Australia changed over time by gender?</li>
        </ul>
